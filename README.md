Android-Sample-App
==================

An Android Sample App with Sharethrough SDK integration that displays in-feed native ads.

1. Clone the sample app - `git clone git@github.com:sharethrough/Android-Sample-App.git`
2. Get the latest Android SDK aar [here](https://github.com/sharethrough/Android-SDK/releases) and replace the current `sharethrough-android-sdk.aar` file in the `lib` folder. If you do not replace the lib you will be using an outdated Sharethrough SDK
3. The app can now be compiled and run

Please see our [developer docs](http://developers.sharethrough.com/android) for specific integration information
